Project title: Robotic Process Automation in the NHS

Allocated supervisor: Marco Palomino

Vision:This project aims to develop a functional environment to operate Robotic Process Automation (RPA). 
We want to make use of the Software Development Life Cycle to apply existing programming 
knowledge to the UIPath Tool with some examples of workflows, coding and state machines.
The work will be within a IT project based environment using Dev-Ops/Agile practices and 
philosophies to integrate the processes between development and IT. In addition there will be the 
use of Lean principles through business analysis methods to streamline the development life cycle will 
be required.
The project will need to establish testing methods and practices to satisfy local and external (NHSe –
National Health Service England) practices, legal and client requirements. It will also be establishing
deployment methods for smooth release of automations placing them into routine procedure before 
consideration for ongoing support needs to be addressed.
Key to the project will be the continuous evaluation practices through benefit reporting which will 
consider both the organisation, NHSe and the patients of the University Hospital Plymouth Trust 
(UHPT). The key reasons behind the project are to increase the Trust efficiency, save the Trust money, 
enable clinical staff to increase patient care and allow new activities to be established.
To align with the Trust’s Performance Information Teams vision, this project will be ‘Implementing 
RPA to positively impact the NHS and patient care’.
